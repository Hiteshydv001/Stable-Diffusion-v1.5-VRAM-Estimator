    "# GPU-vRAM Usage Estimation for Diffusion Models\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Derive an analytical equation to estimate peak vRAM usage during inference for the `stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5` for arbitrary input image sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "vRAM consumption during diffusion model inference differs significantly from model size on disk. Peak memory depends on:\n",
    " - Model weights (fixed)\n",
    " - Intermediate activations (vary with image dimensions and prompt length)\n",
    " - Framework overhead (CUDA kernels, workspace buffers)\n",
    " - Attention mechanism memory scaling (O(N²) with sequence length)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    " - `H`, `W` = input image height and width\n",
    " - `prompt_length` = tokenized prompt length\n",
    " - Identify any additional factors affecting vRAM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    " - Analyze the architecture: Understand UNet, VAE, CLIP text encoder, and how tensors flow through the pipeline\n",
    " - Account for precision: Assume `FP16` (2 bytes/parameter)\n",
    " - Model fully on GPU: Ignore pipeline.enable_model_cpu_offload() in your equation\n",
    " - Peak, not average: Find the stage with maximum memory allocation\n",
    " - Document assumptions: Clearly state what you include/exclude (e.g., gradient storage, optimizer states)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    " - Equation with explanation of each term\n",
    " - Derivation notes showing how you arrived at each component\n",
    " - Validation (optional but encouraged): Compare equation predictions against actual nvidia-smi measurements using the provided test code"
